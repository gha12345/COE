* People: Trustwave ASOCs are staffed with a highly skilled combination of security professionals ranging from security analysts to security architects and forensic investigators. Not only do these skilled security professionals provide local coverage across various security disciplines, they can assist other regions (or be assisted) as necessary. By federating our security operations, Trustwave is able to provide the exact skill in the exact location across the globe whenever or wherever it’s needed.
* Process: Trustwave has spent more than twenty years honing our ability to detect the latest threats. From security analyst review through machine learning, these unique processes are combined with our customer support infrastructure to allow every ASOC to deliver the exact same level of service. And since processes are identical, if something starts in one location, it can be transferred and picked up in another with zero disruption to the process or to customers.
* Technology: Technology forms the backbone of our federated ASOCs. From the distributed Trustwave Security monitoring and investigation architecture that allows for local storage of customer data while sharing relevant global security information to a managed security services portal that is shared both by customers and our security analysts. Technology truly connects all Trustwave people, processes and locations. Many Trustwave ASOCs are also co-located with some of the world’s largest telco providers, allowing for unprecedented threat intelligence sharing facilitated by Trustwave
